# ZAsteroids

--------

Originally written by Sam Claassens and Daniel Gawryjolek.
Sam - Added in some extra stuff to make it support Oculus Rift DK2 (Runtime version > v0.43). 

Game information: https://semisortedblog.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/introducing-zasteroids-full-game-and-codebase/

--------

A XNA-based twist on the original Asteroids game - it's 3D, Oculus Rift-enabled, and has enough crepuscular rays to blind a small rhino. 

To build in Visual Studio 2013:
1. Pull down the repo
2. Install XNA Refresh (http://mxa.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230)
3. Install WIX if you want to build the installer as well (https://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/610859)
4. Build and play!

The binaries are also available on SemiSorted (https://semisortedblog.wordpress.com/).
